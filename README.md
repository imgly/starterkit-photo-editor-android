The starter kit is built on top of the Creative Editor SDK. 
Built to provide versatile photo editing capabilities.
Toggling from edit and preview modes enables users to evaluate their edited photo before export.
A dock at the bottom of the editor provides quick access to the most essential photo editing tools allowing users to tweak adjustments, crop the photo, and add filters, effects, blur, text, shapes, as well as stickers.
